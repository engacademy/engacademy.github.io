		Reedit’s College Essay

My diversion from the Bangladeshi clan was also motivated by the wide gap between Bangladeshi ideas of success and my own. The Bangladeshi community around me failed to see what I saw - the contrast between our prospects in America and those of the Indians. That small community acted with quixotic fashion toward questionable goals; not knowing what it took to have a successful life, they made a fantasy and a mockery of one. In their eyes the successful person is pious above all else and spurns worldly successes. This is but an infantile response to adversity; they see that America will not grant them cultural hegemony and vast wealth, so they claim that was not their goal in the first place; they move the goalposts. This is all in stark contrast to the Indians, who built a substantial network of family friends to ensure that their offspring would attend the best colleges, work the best jobs, and enjoy the best lives. This contrast came to engulf me; I came to see association with the Indian crowd as a better route.


Here the instruments of my parents’ cultural camouflage came to assist me. There was nothing to set me apart from the Indian Hindus; my name contained neither Syed nor Islam, the names of the men of several generations of my father’s family. Rather, my name was a Bengali name, albeit a corruption, generally given to Hindus. So I had a reason and a means to change my colors.


Going into high school, I didn’t know that extracurricular activities were important in order to go to selective colleges; I didn’t understand anything about who to talk to, where to go, or what it meant to be a “club officer.” Having no older siblings to guide me, no useful information coming from my parents or family friends, and having come from a different middle school, I didn’t even know which classes I had to take to graduate.


But I picked up the intimations of the Indian people rather quickly. I learned their perspectives, their peculiarities, and their motives. At first, I was not asked to explain myself; the tone of my skin and the sound of my name spoke for themselves. But the punches rained down slowly; soon, I was asked about which state in India my parents came from, what language I spoke, and what caste I was. Only by dodging these questions could I continue my newfound access to the incredible information present in the Indian family network. One of my new friends knew several CEOs, another knew all of the channels for getting internships, and another had several family friends going to Stanford and UC Berkeley, so at least I knew I was gaining something, albeit intangible.


The point is inarguably made against me that I have used others for information. But that argument fails to consider the alternative: without learning from the Indian community, I would likely have turned out as many of my predecessors in the Bangladeshi community had - in community colleges or in menial work, with little hope of moving to the upper echelons of our rigidly structured society, and without such a goal in mind.


It should also be noted that my ensuingly high level of academic success relative to other Bangladeshi students of my age galvanized the Bangladeshi community in support of me. The same parents who had so zealously deemed me a cultural pariah began to come to me to help their children with homework, or to talk about my interests with them, things I eagerly did but silently resented.


Of course, I still had numerous disadvantages relative to Indians with significant familial networks. Most other children wouldn’t give me any information, some because they had realized the game I played for my survival, others because they were quiet. And slowly the information would leak out, that I was not one of them, that I was different, that I was supposed to be somehow foreign to them. In a matter of weeks, the new ostracism set in. The epithets, the slurs, this time compounded by orders of magnitude. The chameleon finds himself in the same situation, set against new colors.


Only for fleeting moments have I felt the grace of social acceptance. It is for this reason that I have struggled with the question of fitting in versus standing out multiple times.


The only solution to being culturally generic was to be quiet, to act as a fly on the wall. And the inevitable result was a carousel of cultures - the chameleon’s colors - that ultimately ended in rejection. By trying to become a combination of all colors, the chameleon sacrifices his identity as any and every one of them. After all, the mixture of every color just turns out to be a dark, ugly shade of brown.
